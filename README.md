# Backstage Playground

This is my personal playground for everything [Backstage](backstage). I will use this to play around, learn, and showcase. All the data is generated by `create-backstage-app` with a sprinkle of myself so I can use that to play around with.

So far, this repository only contains customization to the `CatalogIndexPage` and `UserEntityPage`.

To start the app, run:

```sh
yarn install
yarn dev
```
